This project was developed as part of my third-year university internship. It showcases my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical tasks and demonstrates my skills in software development, problem-solving, and project implementation. Through this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience and further honed my technical abilities, preparing me for real-world challenges in the field.
